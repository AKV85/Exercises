A number of exercises to practice 'whiteboard' interview questions in PHP.

Inside `exercises` directory, you can find folders containing the exercises and completed versions.
There are multiple ways to solve each problem, feel free to experiment.

## Install

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `composer install`.

## Usage

1. Pick an exercise for example `exercises/ReverseString` and inside `tests/ReverseString/ReverseStringTest.php` delete `static::markTestSkipped();`.
2. Run `./vendor/bin/phpunit` or `./vendor/bin/phpunit-watcher watch` to start tests.
3. Write implementation.

This will allow you to write code and be sure that the solution is correct.
