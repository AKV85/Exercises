A number of exercises to practice whiteboard interview questions in PHP.

Inside `exercises` directory, you can find folders containing the exercises and completed versions.
There are multiple ways to solve each problem, feel free to experiment.

If you are stuck don't be afraid to search online for a pseudo-code algorithm or a solution. Even by copying and later analyzing the solution you will gain lots of experience in problem solving.

Also check out the tests and see what results are expected. Playing around with [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) is a plus.

## Install

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `composer install`.

## Usage

1. Pick an exercise for example `exercises/ReverseString` and inside `tests/ReverseString/ReverseStringTest.php` delete `static::markTestSkipped();`.
2. Run `./vendor/bin/phpunit` or `./vendor/bin/phpunit-watcher watch` to start tests.
3. Write implementation.

This will allow you to write code and be sure that the solution is correct.
